  Turns the built in LED on for two 1 second blinks, with a 1 second delay between the two blinks
  then turns the LED on for two 2 second blinks, with a 2 second delay between the two blinks

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
